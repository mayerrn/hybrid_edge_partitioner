Hybrid Edge Partitioner
=============================================

Implementation of HEP, as published in SIGMOD 2021.

In Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD ’21), June 20–25, 2021, Virtual Event, China.

Compilation and Usage
---------------------

We tested our program on Ubuntu 18.04, and it requires the following
packages: `cmake`, `glog`, `gflags`, `boost`:
```
sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev libgflags-dev libboost-all-dev
```

Compilation:
```
git clone <this repository>
cd <repository_name>
mkdir release && cd release
cmake ..
make -j8
```

Usage:
```
$ ./main --help
main: -filename <path to the input graph> [-method hep] [-hdf <threshold / \tau>] [-p <number of partitions>] 
```

**Example.** Partition the Orkut graph into 8 parts using HEP with \tau = 10.0:
```
$ ./main -p 8 -method hep -hdf 10.0 -filename /path/to/com-orkut.ungraph.txt
```

Acknowledgements
---------------------
Parts of the implementation are based on the NE reference implementation provided by Qin Liu: https://github.com/ansrlab/edgepart

This refers to the following classes. Some of them were adapted to fit the different data formats in HEP/NE++ compared to NE.
conversions.cpp/hpp,
dense_bitset.hpp,
edgepart.hpp,
graph.cpp/hpp, 
min_heap.hpp,
util.cpp/hpp

We also integrated (for comparison to NE++) the original implementation of NE:
ne_graph.cpp/hpp,
ne_min_heap.hpp,
ne_partitioner.cpp/hpp
